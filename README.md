## Installation

Instana remotely instruments your Python web servers automatically via [Instana AutoTrace™️]. To configure which Python processes this applies to, see the [configuration page].

##  Manual Installation

If you wish to instrument your applications manually, you can install the package with the following into the `virtualenv`, `pipenv`, or container (hosted on [PyPI]):

    pip install instana

or to alternatively update an existing installation:

    pip install -U instana

### Activating Without Code Changes

The Instana package can then be activated _without any code changes required_ by setting the following environment variable for your Python application:

    export AUTOWRAPT_BOOTSTRAP=instana

This will cause the Instana Python package to instrument your Python application automatically. Once it finds the Instana host agent, it will report Python metrics and distributed traces.

### Activating via Import

Alternatively, if you prefer the manual method, import the `instana` package inside of your Python application:

    import instana

See also our detailed [installation document] for additional information covering Django, Flask, End-user Monitoring (EUM), and more.

## Documentation

You can find more documentation covering supported components and minimum versions in the Instana [documentation portal].
